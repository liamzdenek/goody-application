# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Complete Backend API Implementation**: Successfully implemented and validated all missing API endpoints. Fixed dashboard API bug and added vendor detail reports, recent orders activity, enhanced order filtering, and pagination. All backend infrastructure is fully operational and ready for React frontend implementation.

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Vendor Data**: Using hardcoded vendor list for backfill data generation (implemented in shared types)
2. **Refresh Strategy**: Manual refresh only - no auto-refresh functionality
3. **Authentication**: Out of scope - demo application with no auth required
4. **Reliability Scoring**: Simple percentage: (ARRIVED orders / total completed orders) * 100
5. **Data Retention**: Orders deleted after 30 days, reports kept for 6 months
6. **Logging Strategy**: Using console.log() throughout application (simplified approach)

     - Updates existing order statuses with realistic transitions
     - EventBridge integration for status change events
     - Vendor reliability-based status progression
   - **Report Generator**: DynamoDB Stream triggered reporting
     - 7-day rolling window vendor metrics
     - Reliability score calculations and trend analysis
     - Dashboard summary generation with atomic upserts
   - **Data Backfill**: Historical data generation
     - 21-day backfill with realistic business patterns
     - Hardcoded vendor configurations with reliability profiles
     - Batch writing optimization for DynamoDB
   - All functions successfully build to `dist/packages/backend/`
   - **Complete API Implementation**: All missing endpoints implemented and validated
     - Fixed dashboard API TypeError (filtered SYSTEM reports from vendor processing)
     - Added vendor detail reports with performance metrics and recent issues
     - Added recent orders activity with configurable time windows and metrics
     - Enhanced order filtering with vendor/status/date ranges and pagination
     - Added dashboard summary alias for frontend compatibility
     - Implemented base64-encoded cursor pagination for stateless scaling
     - Added comprehensive error handling with correlation IDs
4. ✅ **Infrastructure Package**: Complete CDK implementation with NX integration
   - **CDK Stack**: GoodyDashboardStack with all AWS resources
     - DynamoDB tables (Orders, Reports) with proper GSIs and streams
     - All 4 Lambda functions with environment variables
     - API Gateway with CORS and Lambda proxy integration
     - EventBridge custom bus with 5-minute order simulation scheduler
     - CloudFront + S3 for frontend hosting with Origin Access Identity
     - IAM roles and policies with least privilege access
   - **NX Integration**: Automated dependency building and deployment
     - `npx nx deploy infrastructure` builds all dependencies automatically
     - AWS profile configuration (lz-demos) for deployment
     - Proper build artifact management in single dist directory
   - **Deployment**: ✅ Successfully deployed GoodyDashboardStack (42/42 resources)
   - **Validation**: ✅ Data backfill (3,084 orders) and report generation (5 vendor reports) verified

## Immediate Next Steps
1. ✅ **CDK Infrastructure**: Complete deployment with all AWS resources operational
2. ✅ **Data Layer Validation**: Historical data and event-driven reporting working
3. ✅ **API Implementation**: All missing endpoints implemented and validated
4. **Frontend Package**: React app with TanStack Router consuming shared types
5. **Order Simulator Testing**: Test EventBridge-triggered order generation
6. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete order lifecycle validation

## Recent Clarifications
- **Vendor List**: Will be hardcoded in backfill lambda (not dynamic)
- **UI Refresh**: Users must manually click refresh button to update data
- **Authentication**: Completely out of scope for this demo
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Keep it simple - just successful delivery percentage
- **Data Lifecycle**: Clear retention policies for orders vs reports
- **UI Mockups**: Complete ASCII mockups documented for all pages including new recent orders view
- **Recent Orders**: New page showing most recently updated orders (not just created) with activity metrics

## Active Architectural Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: `packages/` directory containing all services
- **Build Strategy**: Single `dist/` directory with package subfolders
- **Routing**: TanStack Router explicitly chosen over React Router
- **Styling**: CSS modules with Dropbox design principles (flat, bold colors, transparent buttons)
- **Infrastructure**: CDK with NodejsFunction primitives, no external AWS SDK

## Current Blockers
None - complete backend API implementation operational and validated.

## Operational Status
- **API Gateway URL**: https://6q0ywxpbhh.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/
- **CloudFront URL**: https://d1fkw11r9my6ok.cloudfront.net
- **DynamoDB Orders**: 3,084 records across 21-day historical period
- **DynamoDB Reports**: 5 vendor performance reports automatically generated
- **Event Processing**: DynamoDB streams → Lambda report generation working
- **Order Simulation**: EventBridge scheduler ready for testing
- **Overall System Reliability**: 79.8% based on generated performance data

## API Implementation Details
- **Dashboard Endpoints**: `/dashboard/summary` (alias) and `/api/dashboard` (primary)
- **Vendor Detail Reports**: `/api/vendors/{vendorId}/report` with performance metrics and recent issues
- **Recent Orders Activity**: `/api/orders/recent` with activity metrics and update tracking
- **Enhanced Order Filtering**: `/api/orders` with vendor/status/date filtering and pagination
- **Pagination Strategy**: Base64-encoded JSON cursors for stateless DynamoDB pagination
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with correlation IDs and structured logging
