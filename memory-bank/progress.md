# Progress Status

## Completed Work
- âœ… **Project Planning**: Comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed architecture, database schemas, and API contracts
- âœ… **Requirements Clarification**: All key decisions made regarding vendors, refresh strategy, authentication, scoring, and data retention
- âœ… **Memory Bank Initialization**: Core documentation files created with refined project details
- âœ… **UI Mockups Documentation**: Complete ASCII mockups for all pages including new recent orders functionality
- âœ… **Recent Orders API**: Added `/orders/recent` endpoint specification with activity metrics and update tracking
- âœ… **NX Workspace Setup**: Monorepo initialized with packages structure and build configuration
- âœ… **Shared Types Package**: Complete implementation with comprehensive type system
  - Order lifecycle types with Zod validation (PLACED â†’ SHIPPING â†’ Terminal states)
  - Vendor management types with hardcoded demo vendors for backfill
  - Report and dashboard analytics types with trend calculations
  - Complete API contract types for all endpoints
  - Error handling utilities with console.log logging
  - Validation helpers and middleware for requests

## Current Status
**Phase**: Backend Infrastructure Validated âœ…
**Next**: API Testing and Frontend Implementation

## What Works
- **Project Vision**: Clear understanding of dashboard requirements and user needs
- **Technical Architecture**: Well-defined serverless architecture with event-driven patterns
- **Data Model**: Comprehensive database schemas for Orders, Reports, and Vendors
- **API Design**: Complete REST API contracts with proper response formats
- **UI/UX Design**: ASCII mockups showing expected dashboard layout and interactions
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Complete AWS deployment with all 42 resources operational
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Data backfill â†’ DynamoDB â†’ streams â†’ report generation working
- **Data Layer**: 3,084 historical orders and 5 vendor reports successfully generated
- **Operational Monitoring**: CloudWatch logs, DynamoDB metrics, and deployment automation

## What's Left to Build

### 1. Foundation Setup
- âœ… Initialize NX monorepo workspace
- âœ… Create `.gitignore` with `.env` and `.env.*` entries
- âœ… Setup shared types package with Zod schemas
- âœ… Configure build system for single `dist/` directory output

### 2. Backend Implementation
- âœ… Create Lambda functions package with Express server
- âœ… Implement API Handler with serverless-http and CORS
- âœ… Implement health check endpoint with dependency status
- âœ… Implement orders, vendors, reports, and dashboard endpoints
- âœ… Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- âœ… Add proper error handling with shared error utilities
- âœ… Implement Order Simulator with proper PLAN.md decision logic
- âœ… Implement Report Generator with DynamoDB Stream trigger
- âœ… Implement Data Backfill with hardcoded vendor list

### 3. Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create React package with TanStack Router
- [ ] Implement dashboard overview with manual refresh
- [ ] Implement vendor detail view
- [ ] Implement order listing view
- [ ] Implement recent order updates page with activity feed
- [ ] Apply CSS modules with Dropbox design principles

### 4. Infrastructure
- âœ… Create CDK stack with TypeScript
- âœ… Deploy DynamoDB tables with GSI patterns for recent orders queries
- âœ… Deploy API Gateway and Lambda functions
- âœ… Deploy S3 + CloudFront with Origin Access Identity
- âœ… Configure EventBridge scheduler for order simulation
- âœ… Configure NX deployment automation with dependency management

### 5. Data Layer
- âœ… Implement DynamoDB table schemas
- âœ… Create GSI access patterns for efficient queries
- âœ… Implement data retention policies (30 days orders, 6 months reports)
- âœ… Generate 21-day historical backfill data (3,084 orders validated)
- âœ… Validate DynamoDB Stream â†’ Report Generator workflow (5 reports generated)

### 6. Testing & Validation
- âœ… Data Backfill Function: Successfully generated realistic historical data
- âœ… Report Generator: Automated vendor performance metrics via DynamoDB streams
- âœ… Infrastructure Deployment: All 42 AWS resources operational
- [ ] API Health Check: Test main API endpoints for functionality
- [ ] Order Simulator: Test EventBridge-triggered order generation
- [ ] End-to-End Flow: Complete order lifecycle validation

## Known Issues
- **Report Generator Dashboard Summary**: Minor vendorId key error in dashboard endpoint (vendor reports work correctly)
- **GSI Limitations**: Removed recentUpdatesIndex due to schema conflicts (functionality covered by statusIndex)

## Next Immediate Action
ðŸŽ¯ **API Testing**: Complete incremental testing of remaining components (API health check, order simulator, end-to-end flow) before frontend implementation.

## Recently Completed Infrastructure
- **âœ… Complete Backend Deployment**: GoodyDashboardStack with 42/42 resources operational
- **âœ… Data Validation**: 3,084 orders and 5 vendor reports successfully generated and verified
- **âœ… Event-Driven Architecture**: DynamoDB streams triggering report generation working perfectly
- **âœ… NX Automation**: Streamlined deployment with `npx nx deploy infrastructure`
- **âœ… Operations Documentation**: Comprehensive operations.md with all deployed resource details
- **âœ… Performance Validation**: Lambda functions executing efficiently with proper memory/timeout settings
