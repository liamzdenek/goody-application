# Progress Status

## Completed Work
- ✅ **Project Planning**: Comprehensive PLAN.md with detailed architecture, database schemas, and API contracts
- ✅ **Requirements Clarification**: All key decisions made regarding vendors, refresh strategy, authentication, scoring, and data retention
- ✅ **Memory Bank Initialization**: Core documentation files created with refined project details
- ✅ **UI Mockups Documentation**: Complete ASCII mockups for all pages including new recent orders functionality
- ✅ **Recent Orders API**: Added `/orders/recent` endpoint specification with activity metrics and update tracking

## Current Status
**Phase**: Project Foundation Setup
**Ready to Build**: Yes - all clarifications received and documented

## What Works
- **Project Vision**: Clear understanding of dashboard requirements and user needs
- **Technical Architecture**: Well-defined serverless architecture with event-driven patterns
- **Data Model**: Comprehensive database schemas for Orders, Reports, and Vendors
- **API Design**: Complete REST API contracts with proper response formats
- **UI/UX Design**: ASCII mockups showing expected dashboard layout and interactions

## What's Left to Build

### 1. Foundation Setup
- [ ] Initialize NX monorepo workspace
- [ ] Create `.gitignore` with `.env` and `.env.*` entries
- [ ] Setup shared types package with Zod schemas
- [ ] Configure build system for single `dist/` directory output

### 2. Backend Implementation
- [ ] Create Lambda functions package
- [ ] Implement Order Simulator with EventBridge trigger
- [ ] Implement Report Generator with DynamoDB Stream trigger
- [ ] Implement Data Backfill with hardcoded vendor list
- [ ] Implement API Handler with serverless-http

### 3. Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create React package with TanStack Router
- [ ] Implement dashboard overview with manual refresh
- [ ] Implement vendor detail view
- [ ] Implement order listing view
- [ ] Implement recent order updates page with activity feed
- [ ] Apply CSS modules with Dropbox design principles

### 4. Infrastructure
- [ ] Create CDK stack with TypeScript
- [ ] Deploy DynamoDB tables with GSI patterns for recent orders queries
- [ ] Deploy API Gateway and Lambda functions
- [ ] Deploy S3 + CloudFront with Origin Access Identity
- [ ] Configure EventBridge scheduler for order simulation

### 5. Data Layer
- [ ] Implement DynamoDB table schemas
- [ ] Create GSI access patterns for efficient queries
- [ ] Implement data retention policies (30 days orders, 6 months reports)
- [ ] Generate 21-day historical backfill data

### 6. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Implement curl/AWS CLI testing scripts
- [ ] Validate build artifacts after configuration changes
- [ ] Test deployment and data flow end-to-end

## Known Issues
None at this time - project is in planning phase.

## Next Immediate Action
Start with NX workspace initialization and shared types package creation.
